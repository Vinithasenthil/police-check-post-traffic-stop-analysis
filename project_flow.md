# Project Flow – Police Check Post Traffic Stop Analysis System

## Step 1: Data Collection
Traffic stop data was collected in CSV/Excel format containing vehicle, driver, stop, search, and arrest details.

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Python and Pandas were used to clean the raw data, handle missing values, and prepare it for database storage.

## Step 3: Database Design
A MySQL database table was designed with appropriate columns and data types to store traffic stop records.

## Step 4: Data Insertion
The cleaned dataset was inserted into the MySQL database using Python scripts.

## Step 5: SQL Analysis
SQL queries were executed to analyze traffic stop patterns such as repeat offenders, frequent searches, and arrest trends.

## Step 6: Result Documentation
Key observations derived from SQL analysis were documented for interpretation.

## Step 7: Dashboard Development
A Streamlit dashboard was developed to visualize analyzed data and provide interactive filtering and insights.

## Final Outcome
The project delivers a complete traffic stop analysis system integrating data preprocessing, database management, SQL analytics, and visualization.
